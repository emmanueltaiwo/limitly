# Introduction to Limitly

Limitly is a **TypeScript-first rate limiting SDK** for Node.js and browsers. Redis-backed distributed rate limiting with zero configuration.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting controls traffic to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain service availability.

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Get started instantly with sensible defaults
- **Redis-Backed**: Distributed rate limiting across multiple servers
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and IDE autocomplete
- **Flexible**: Customize limits per user, endpoint, or use case
- **Production Ready**: Error handling, timeouts, and best practices built-in

```typescript
import { rateLimit } from 'limitly-sdk';

const checkLimit = rateLimit();
const result = await checkLimit('user-123');

if (result.allowed) {
  console.log(`Remaining: ${result.remaining}`);
}
```

## Use Cases

- **API Protection**: Protect REST/GraphQL APIs from abuse
- **User Tiers**: Different limits for free/premium/enterprise users
- **Endpoint Limits**: Custom limits per endpoint based on resource usage
- **Bot Protection**: Prevent automated attacks with strict IP-based limits

## How It Works

Limitly uses the **Token Bucket Algorithm**:
- Each identifier gets a bucket with maximum capacity
- Requests consume tokens; tokens refill at a constant rate
- Allows smooth traffic with burst handling

## Getting Started

1. Install: `npm install limitly-sdk`
2. Use: `const checkLimit = rateLimit(); await checkLimit('user-123');`

See [Installation](./installation) for setup or [Quick Start](./quick-start) for examples.
